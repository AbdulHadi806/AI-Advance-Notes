# ML Common Algorithms

## Classifiers

### Decision Tree Classifier

A decision tree takes the best feature and creates decision node based on that feature. Than the data is split into two branches based on whether the samples satisfy the condition of that feature or not . Decision tree has low Bias and High Variance.

**Low Bias** Model is trained well on the training dataset. Training gives fewer errors.

**High Variance** When the model is given new data than it may give larger errors.

### Random Forest Classifier

In Random Forest Classifier, we take random rows from the subset and provide it to the decision trees, Random Forest Classifier has low variance and high Bias

Random Forest Increases Bias while decreases variance because of the term averaging, in random forest majority trees answer is taken as output.
